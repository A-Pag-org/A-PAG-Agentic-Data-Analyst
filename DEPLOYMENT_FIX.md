# Fix for Vercel 404 NOT_FOUND Error (bom1 identifier)

## Problem
The deployment was returning a 404 NOT_FOUND error with error code `bom1::n6thv-1759651661148-e029e0b2e188`.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Public Directory**: Next.js applications require a `public` directory for static assets
2. **Standalone Output Mode**: The `output: 'standalone'` configuration in `next.config.js` is unnecessary for Vercel deployments
3. **Missing 404 Handler**: No custom not-found page was defined for better error handling
4. **Missing Error Boundaries**: No global error handler was in place

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Public Directory and Assets
- Created `frontend/public/` directory
- Added `robots.txt` for search engine crawlers

### 2. Created Custom Error Pages
- **`frontend/src/app/not-found.tsx`**: Custom 404 page with user-friendly UI
- **`frontend/src/app/error.tsx`**: Global error boundary for handling runtime errors

### 3. Updated Next.js Configuration (`frontend/next.config.js`)
- ✅ Removed `output: 'standalone'` (Vercel handles this automatically)
- ✅ Added `poweredByHeader: false` for security
- ✅ Added `compress: true` for better performance
- ✅ Added `generateEtags: true` for caching
- ✅ Added `unoptimized` for development images

### 4. Enhanced Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- ✅ Added security headers:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

### 5. Added Middleware (`frontend/src/middleware.ts`)
- Custom middleware for additional security headers
- Proper path matching configuration
- HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

## Testing the Fix

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the frontend
cd frontend && pnpm build

# Start the production server
pnpm start
```

### Vercel Deployment
The changes should automatically fix the 404 error when deployed to Vercel:

1. The custom not-found page will handle any 404 errors gracefully
2. The error boundary will catch and display any runtime errors
3. Security headers will be properly set
4. Static assets will be served correctly from the public directory

## Expected Behavior

After deployment:
- ✅ Homepage loads correctly at `/`
- ✅ 404 errors show custom not-found page instead of default error
- ✅ Runtime errors are caught by error boundary
- ✅ Security headers are set on all responses
- ✅ Static files (robots.txt) are accessible

## Monitoring

To verify the fix is working:
1. Visit the root URL: Should show the RAG Data Analyst homepage
2. Visit a non-existent page: Should show custom 404 page
3. Check response headers: Should include security headers
4. Check `/robots.txt`: Should be accessible

## Additional Notes

- The `bom1` identifier in the error code refers to Vercel's Mumbai (Bombay) region
- This was a deployment configuration issue, not a code issue
- The changes improve both error handling and security posture

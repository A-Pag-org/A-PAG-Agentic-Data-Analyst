# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Issue: Health Check Failure

The app was failing to start because the OpenAI API key was not configured. The app has now been fixed to start even without the API key, but you need to configure it to use the app's features.

## Solution: Configure OpenAI API Key

### On Streamlit Cloud:

1. Go to your app's dashboard on [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Click on the app menu (⋮) and select **"Settings"**
3. Navigate to the **"Secrets"** section
4. Add the following content:

```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-actual-api-key-here"
```

5. Click **"Save"**
6. The app will automatically redeploy with the new secret

### Local Development:

If you're running locally, create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-actual-api-key-here"
```

## What Was Fixed

The app now:
- ✅ Starts successfully even without API key configured
- ✅ Shows clear warning message when API key is missing
- ✅ Prevents analysis from running without API key
- ✅ Provides helpful instructions on how to configure the key

## Next Steps

1. Configure your OpenAI API key using the instructions above
2. Wait for the app to redeploy (automatic on Streamlit Cloud)
3. The app should now work correctly!

## Testing

Once deployed, you should be able to:
- Upload CSV, Excel, or JSON files
- Ask questions about your data
- Generate visualizations
- Perform data analysis using AI

## Support

If you continue to have issues:
- Check that your OpenAI API key is valid
- Ensure you have sufficient credits in your OpenAI account
- Check the Streamlit Cloud logs for any error messages

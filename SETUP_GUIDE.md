2. Enter a User ID (e.g., `demo-user`)
3. Click **"Select File"** and choose your data file
   - Supported formats: CSV, Excel (.xlsx, .xls), JSON
4. Click **"Upload Data"**
5. Wait for the success message

**Example Data Files You Can Use:**
- Sales data with columns: date, product, revenue, quantity
- Customer data with columns: customer_id, name, purchases, total_spent
- Time series data with columns: timestamp, metric_name, value

#### Step 3: Ask Questions About Your Data

1. Go to the **"Analyze Data"** tab
2. Enter your User ID (same as used for upload)
3. Type your question in natural language, for example:
   ```
   What are the top 5 products by revenue?
   ```
   ```
   Show me sales trends for the last quarter
   ```
   ```
   Which customers have the highest lifetime value?
   ```
   ```
   Compare Q1 and Q2 performance
   ```

4. **Optional Settings:**
   - ‚úÖ Check **"Generate Visualizations"** for charts and graphs
   - ‚úÖ Check **"Include Forecasting"** for predictive analytics

5. Click **"Analyze Data"**

#### Step 4: View Results

After analysis completes, you'll see:

1. **Text Answer**: Natural language response to your question
2. **Interactive Visualizations**: Charts, graphs, and plots
3. **Insights**: Key findings and patterns
4. **Forecast Data**: Future predictions (if enabled)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Upload failed"
**Solutions:**
- Verify your backend is running on port 8000
- Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` is set correctly
- Ensure your data file is in a supported format (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Check backend logs for specific error messages

### Issue: "Analysis failed"
**Solutions:**
- Make sure you've uploaded data for this User ID
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- Check that your Supabase database is accessible
- Ensure the query is clear and specific

### Issue: Backend won't start
**Solutions:**
- Check all required environment variables are set in `.env`
- Verify Python dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Make sure port 8000 is not in use by another application
- Check Supabase credentials are correct

### Issue: Frontend won't start
**Solutions:**
- Ensure Node.js version is 18 or higher
- Run `npm install` in the frontend directory
- Check that `.env.local` has required variables
- Delete `.next` folder and restart: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`

### Issue: No visualizations showing
**Solutions:**
- Make sure "Generate Visualizations" checkbox is enabled
- Verify your query asks for data that can be visualized
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Try a different chart type or query

### Issue: Slow analysis
**Solutions:**
- Large datasets may take longer to process
- Complex queries require more AI processing time
- Check your OpenAI API rate limits

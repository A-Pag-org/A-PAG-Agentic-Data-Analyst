# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem Identified
The 404 NOT_FOUND error was occurring because your Vercel deployment was trying to deploy from a branch that only contained a README.md file. The actual project code existed on a different branch (`cursor/setup-project-repository-and-ci-cd-b153`).

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Files Restored
- Brought all project files from the setup branch to the current branch
- Full monorepo structure is now available including frontend, backend, and shared packages

### 2. Vercel Configuration Updated
Updated `vercel.json` at the root with Turborepo support:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "buildCommand": "cd .. && pnpm turbo run build --filter=@rag-data-analyst/frontend",
  "devCommand": "pnpm dev",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install --frozen-lockfile",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "rootDirectory": "frontend",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "ignoreCommand": "git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD ./frontend"
}
```

### 3. Conflicting Configuration Removed
Removed `frontend/vercel.json` to avoid conflicts with root configuration.

### 4. Vercel Ignore File
Created `.vercelignore` to exclude unnecessary files (backend, docker, docs) from deployment.

## Required Actions in Vercel Dashboard

### Option 1: Update Root Directory (Recommended for Monorepos)
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **General**
3. Under **Root Directory**, set it to: `frontend`
4. Under **Build & Development Settings**:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js
   - **Build Command**: `pnpm build`
   - **Output Directory**: Leave as default (`.next`)
   - **Install Command**: `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`

### Option 2: Use Root-Level Configuration
If you prefer to keep the root directory as-is, the current `vercel.json` configuration should work as-is.

### Environment Variables (Required)
Set these environment variables in Vercel Dashboard (**Settings** → **Environment Variables**):

**Production & Preview:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-api-url.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=RAG Data Analyst
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=0.1.0
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_GIS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FORECASTING=true
```

**Optional (if using demo mode):**
```
DEMO_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

### Deploy Branch
Make sure Vercel is deploying from the correct branch:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Git**
2. Set **Production Branch** to: `cursor/investigate-vercel-not-found-error-cb35` (or merge this into `main` first)

## Fix for "pnpm install" Error

### Problem
Initial deployment failed with: `Command "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile" exited with 1`

**Cause:** Missing `pnpm-lock.yaml` file in the repository.

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ Generated `pnpm-lock.yaml` by running `pnpm install` locally
2. ✅ Updated `vercel.json` to use `--frozen-lockfile` instead of `--no-frozen-lockfile`
3. ✅ Fixed deprecated `experimental.serverActions` in `next.config.js` (no longer needed in Next.js 14.2)
4. ✅ Verified build works locally with turbo command

### Testing the Fix

After making these changes in Vercel:
1. Trigger a new deployment (commit and push these changes)
2. Or manually redeploy from the Vercel dashboard
3. The build should succeed and deploy the Next.js frontend

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** all changes to trigger a new deployment
2. **Configure environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
3. **Update root directory** setting if using Option 1
4. **Monitor the build logs** in Vercel to ensure successful deployment

## Build Notes

- This is a monorepo using **pnpm** and **Turborepo**
- The frontend is a **Next.js 14** application with Chakra UI
- Build time: ~2-5 minutes (typical for Next.js apps)
- The backend is Python-based and should be deployed separately (not on Vercel)
